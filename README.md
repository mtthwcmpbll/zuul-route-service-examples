# Smart CF Route Services with Zuul+Ribbon

This repo contains some example applications demonstrating the use of Netflix Zuul+Ribbon
as a smart route service.  Each submodule will include a readme to describe that particular
example (except for `hello-app`, which is a simple hello world app to bind to the route services
to experiment).
